# LaTeX HK Writer

This is a work in progress, yet functionnal version, of a Lua Pandoc LaTeX document writer.

It aims to render native TiKz graphics un LaTex. The graphics is given as a block of code (CodeBlock Pandoc element). It can be either TiKz code or PlantUML code.

PlantUMl is used to generate on the fly TiKz code from PlanUML code.
